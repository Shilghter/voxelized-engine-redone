# voxel-terrain-engine

This project is a revisit of an old project of mine from 6 years ago with simple voxelized terrain engine, which you can still find on my profile. I thought it would be both fun and useful to modernize the engine and recreate it in much more reliable, optimized and useful state. The project will be completely rewritten, but eventough old one will be a starting point I'm creating a separate reposity for it as I know that the project itself as well as most of the code will end up having very little in common with the old one. I wouldn't want the old frames to slow down progress. Also the old project was a graduation project in which license permitted me to share this project, but other usage was kinda doubful. This time I will get rid of reasearch part with different options to test and go for the most efficents ones and release everything under MIT license. Feel free to use the project howevr you need it with respect to fair play rules. I would also appreciate some feedback if it's been useful to you anyhow :)
